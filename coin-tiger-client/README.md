##Motivation

CoinTiger is a project I built as part of my passion to learn more about Bitcoin, Ethereum and cryptocurrency markets. 

CoinTiger is an investment management tool for building baskets of cryptoassets and gaining the capability to view how these baskets perform over time. This tool is ideally suited for a thesis-driven investor who wants to be able to compare how different investment theses play out with objective metrics. 

The primary performance metric calculated by CoinTiger is percentage change in basket value:

Performance: ((CurrentBasketValue - InitialBasketValue) / InitialBasketValue) * 100% 

For example, the 2020Majors Basket is a simple mixture of 50% Bitcoin and 50% Ethereum with an indexing date set at January 01 2020. While many people are interested in trying to beat the market, people who mainly want exposure to cryptoassets as a whole are probably best off sticking with the top cryptoassets, hence the name “Majors”. The main reason for this is that the rest of the cryptoasset market tends to follow the lead of Bitcoin and Ethereum, making 2020Majors a solid benchmark.
